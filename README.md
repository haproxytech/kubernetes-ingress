### Description

An ingress controller is a Kubernetes resource that routes traffic from outside your cluster to services within the cluster.

Detailed documentation can be found within the [Official Documentation](https://www.haproxy.com/documentation/kubernetes/latest/).

You can also find in this repository a list of all available [Ingress annotations](https://github.com/haproxytech/kubernetes-ingress/blob/master/documentation/README.md).
### Usage

Docker image is available on Docker Hub: [haproxytech/kubernetes-ingress](https://hub.docker.com/r/haproxytech/kubernetes-ingress)

If you prefer to build it from source use (change to appropriate platform if needed with TARGETPLATFORM, default platform is linux/amd64)

```bash
make build
```
With non default platform add appropriate TARGETPLATFORM

```bash
make build TARGETPLATFORM=linux/arm/v6
```

Example environment can be created with

```bash
make example
```

Please see [controller.md](https://github.com/haproxytech/kubernetes-ingress/blob/master/documentation/controller.md) for all available arguments of controler image.

Available customisations are described in [doc](https://github.com/haproxytech/kubernetes-ingress/blob/master/documentation/README.md)

Basic setup to to run controller is described in [yaml](https://github.com/haproxytech/kubernetes-ingress/blob/master/deploy/haproxy-ingress.yaml) file.

```bash
kubectl apply -f deploy/haproxy-ingress.yaml
```
